Hi, I am Emmanuel Uwa

*Cybersecurity Engineer | Penetration Tester | Full-Stack Secure Developer | Cloud Engineer*


I'm a passionate cybersecurity practitioner and cloud-focused engineer with hands-on experience across offensive and defensive security. I love building secure systems from the ground up and finding creative, ethical ways to break them to make them stronger.

I bridge the gap between offensive and defensive mindsets while delivering robust, secure web applications and cloud-native infrastructures.

My expertise lies in real-world impact: proactively identifying vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them, and designing resilient defenses against sophisticated attacks.
