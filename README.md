Hi, I am Emmanuel Uwa

**Cybersecurity Engineer | Penetration Tester | Full-Stack Secure Developer | Cloud Engineer**

I am a passionate cybersecurity practitioner and cloud-focused engineer with hands-on experience across offensive and defensive security. I love building secure systems from the ground up and finding creative, ethical ways to break them to make them stronger.

I bridge the gap between offensive and defensive mindsets while delivering robust, secure web applications and cloud-native infrastructures.

My expertise lies in real-world impact: proactively identifying vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them, and designing resilient defenses against sophisticated attacks.

Core Specializations

Cybersecurity Focus
	• Penetration Testing / Ethical Hacking / Offensive Security — Simulating attacks, vulnerability assessment and red teaming.
	• Defensive security practices: hardening, monitoring, and secure design.
	• Application & Web Security — Secure coding, OWASP Top 10, DevSecOps integration, SAST/DAST.	
	• Incident Response & Threat Detection/Hunting — SIEM/SOAR/XDR tools, forensics, malware analysis, root cause investigation.
	• Network Security & Zero Trust Architecture — Firewalls, segmentation, endpoint protection; implementing Zero Trust models.
	• Cloud Security — Expertise in AWS, Azure, GCP (IAM, encryption, compliance like CIS, NIST). Multi-cloud and serverless security are critical as migrations accelerate.
	• Phishing Assessments — Designing, Executing, and Analyzing simulated campaigns to strengthen user awareness and controls.
	         	         
🌐 Web Application Development
	•	Designing and building modern web applications with security in mind.
	•	Secure authentication and authorization flows.
	•	API design and testing.
	•	Understanding how development decisions impact security outcomes.

☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure Security
	•	Cloud security fundamentals and misconfiguration analysis.
	•	Secure deployment and configuration of cloud services such as:
	  infrastructure as code (Terraform, CloudFormation), CI/CD security, and container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker) with a security-first mindset.
	•	Identity, access management, and least-privilege design.
	•	Bridging the gap between cloud engineering and cloud security.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
